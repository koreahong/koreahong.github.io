# 597. Friend Requests I: Overall Acceptance Rate
## basic

```sql
SELECT
ROUND(
    IFNULL(
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT requester_id, accepter_id FROM RequestAccepted) AS A)
    /
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT sender_id, send_to_id FROM FriendRequest) AS B),
    0)
, 2) AS accept_rate;
```
- 문제를 제대로 읽자 / 매칭된 request중 accept가 아니라 전체 request대비 accept 비율을 알아보는 것

# 1398. Customers Who Bought Products A and B but Not C
## basic / advanced count

- 내풀이

```sql
select customer_id, customer_name
from   customers
where  customer_id not in (select distinct customer_id
                           from   orders
                           where  product_name = 'C')
       and customer_id in (select distinct customer_id
                           from   orders
                           where  product_name = 'B')
       and customer_id in (select distinct customer_id
                           from   orders
                           where  product_name = 'A')
```

- solution
```sql
SELECT o.customer_id,
       c.customer_name,
       o.product_name
FROM   customers c
       INNER JOIN orders o
               ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP  BY o.customer_id
HAVING Count(o.product_name IN ( 'A', 'B' )
              OR NULL) > 1
       AND Count(o.product_name = 'C'
                  OR NULL) = 0 
```
- `count( or null) 뜻은 count(boolean True, False) 값을 세겠다는 뜻 -> where절없이 바로 count 사용가능`
- `반드시 or null을 사용해서 참인값을 세게 해야함. true or null -> true, False or null -> False`

# 1225. Report Contiguous Dates
## datetime / 전체랭크 - 부분랭크

- 내풀이
```sql
SELECT day,
       Rank()
         OVER (
           ORDER BY day)          AS overall_ranking,
       stats,
       rk,
       ( Rank()
           OVER (
             ORDER BY day) - rk ) AS inv

- 위 문제도 차(전체랭크-부분랭크)를 그룹바이로 묶어서 min(날짜), max(날짜)로 추출하는 방법이다
