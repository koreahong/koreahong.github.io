# New Companies

- 잘못된 풀이
```sql
select c.company_code, c.founder, count(distinct(l.lead_manager_code)), count(distinct(s.senior_manager_code)), count(distinct(m.manager_code)), count(distinct(e.employee_code))
from Company c inner join 
     Lead_Manager l on c.company_code = l.company_code inner join
     Senior_Manager s on l.lead_manager_code = s.lead_manager_code inner join
     Manager m on s.senior_manager_code = m.senior_manager_code inner join
     Employee e on m.manager_code = e.manager_code
group by c.company_code, c.founder
```
- 오류 확인 : count(distinct(`(`m.manager_code)) -> count(distinct(m.manager_code))

```sql
SELECT company.company_code, company.founder, lead.lead_count, senior.senior_count,
       manager.manager_count, employee.employee_count
FROM company
 INNER JOIN (SELECT company_code, COUNT(DISTINCT(lead_manager_code)) AS lead_count
             FROM lead_manager
             GROUP BY company_code) lead ON company.company_code = lead.company_code
 INNER JOIN (SELECT company_code, COUNT(DISTINCT(senior_manager_code)) AS senior_count
             FROM senior_manager
             GROUP BY company_code) senior ON company.company_code = senior.company_code
 INNER JOIN (SELECT company_code, COUNT(DISTINCT(manager_code)) AS manager_count

union
select concat('There are total ', count(*), ' ', lcase(Occupation), 's.') from Occupations group By Occupation order by Count(*);
```
