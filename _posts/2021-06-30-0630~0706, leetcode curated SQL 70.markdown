# 511. Game Play Analysis I
## basic

- 내풀이
```sql
select player_id, min(event_date) as first_login
from   activity
group  by player_id

```
# 512. Game Play Analysis II
## basic

- 내풀이

```sql
select player_id, device_id
from   activity
where  (player_id, event_date) in (select player_id, 
                                          min(event_date)
                                   from   activity
                                   group  by player_id)
```

# 534. Game Play Analysis III
## basic / 날짜별 누적합 구하기

- 내풀이  

```sql
select a1.player_id, 
       a1.event_date, 
       sum(a2.games_played) as games_played_so_far
from   activity as a1
       inner join activity as a2
               on a1.event_date >= a2.event_date
                  and a1.player_id = a2.player_id
group  by  a1.player_id, a1.event_date
```

# 534. Game Play Analysis IV
## datetime / 연속된 날짜 조인

- solution

```sql
SELECT Round(Count(t2.player_id) / Count(t1.player_id), 2) AS fraction
FROM   (SELECT player_id,
               Min(event_date) AS first_login
        FROM   activity
        GROUP  BY player_id) t1
       LEFT JOIN activity t2
              ON t1.player_id = t2.player_id
                 AND t1.first_login = t2.event_date - 1 
```

- 문제가 첫로그인한 날짜에 이어 연속적으로 로그인한 유저를 구하는 문제임
    1. 유저별 첫 로그인한 날짜를 구한다
    2. 첫로그인한 날짜와 나머지 날짜 - 1 조건으로 left join한다
    3. 왼쪽테이블은 전체유저가 있고 오른쪽 테이블은 연속적으로 로그인한 유저만 있음(나머지는 null) -> count를 하면 끝

# 570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports
## basic / 서브쿼리생성   

- 내풀이

```sql 
select name
from   employee
where  id in (select managerid    
             from   employee    
             group  by managerid    
             having count(managerid) >= 5)    
``` 
    
# 570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports    
## basic / 서브쿼리생성       
    
- 내풀이    
    
```sql     
select name    
from   employee    
where  id in (select managerid        
             from   employee        
             group  by managerid        
             having count(managerid) >= 5)        
```     
    
# 571. Find Median Given Frequency of Numbers
## basic / 중앙값 구하기     
    
- solution 1 
    
```sql     
select  avg(n.Number) median
from Numbers n
where n.Frequency >= abs((select sum(Frequency) from Numbers where Number<=n.Number) -
                         (select sum(Frequency) from Numbers where Number>=n.Number))
```     

- 왼쪽 , 오른쪽 개수를 따져서 푸는 문제인데 로직은 더 고민해봐야 할거 같다...


- solution 2  

```sql   
with a as (    
    select number,    
           sum(frequency) over (order by number) - frequency as lower_num,    
           sum(frequency) over (order by number) as upper_num,    
           sum(frequency) over () / 2 as medium_num    
    from   numbers     
)    
    
select avg(number) as median    
from   a    
where  medium_num between lower_num and upper_num     
```   

- 그나마 직관적인 풀이 방법이다. 해당컬럼 이전까지 누적개수, 해당컬럼을 포함한 누적개수, 중앙값을 산출하는 방법  

# 534. Game Play Analysis
## basic / 조인

- 내풀이 
``` sql    
select d.dept_name,   
    ifnull(student_number, 0) as student_number   

from   (select s.dept_id,   
           count(s.student_id) as student_number   
    from   student s   
           inner join department d   
                   on s.dept_id = d.dept_id   
           group  by s.dept_id) tbl_cal   
    right join department d   
            on tbl_cal.dept_id = d.dept_id   
order  by student_number desc, d.dept_name   
```     
    
- solution

```sql
SELECT
      dept_name, COUNT(student_id) AS student_number    
FROM    
      department    
      LEFT OUTER JOIN student 
                   ON department.dept_id = student.dept_id    
GROUP BY department.dept_name    
ORDER BY student_number DESC , department.dept_name    
```   
- 확실히 간결하다.
- left join, group by로 바로 계산가능한 문제
- count(컬럼명)하면 널입경우 0으로 표시되는 됨   
    
    
# 586. Customer Placing the Largest Number of Orders 
## basic / limit 활용 

- 내풀이
```sql    
select customer_number    
from   orders    
group  by customer_number    
having customer_number = (select customer_number    
                          from   (select customer_number, count(order_number) as cnt    
                                  from   orders    
                                  group  by customer_number    
                                  order  by cnt desc limit 1    
                                 ) tbl    
                         )    
```                                     

- solution 
```sql    
SELECT 
      customer_number    
FROM    
      orders    
GROUP BY customer_number    
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC    
LIMIT 1    
```
- 이렇게 간단한 것을.... 섭섭쿼리를 사용했네 ㅠㅠ 
- group by -> order by이므로 group by가 적용된 것을 굳이 select문이 아니라 order by에도 사용할 수 있다.


# 586. Customer Placi 
## basic / 연속적인 숫자 조인     

- solution
```sql
select distinct c1.seat_id  
from   cinema c1    
       inner join cinema c2    
               on abs(c1.seat_id -c2.seat_id) = 1    
                  and c1.free = 1    
                  and c2.free = 1   
```
- 조인시 조인옵션에 사칙연산 가능

                               inner join company c
                                       on o.com_id = c.com_id
                        where  c.name = 'RED')  
```
- 모든 부분을 조인할 필요없이 일부만 조인하고, 조인한 결과를 사용하는 형식으로 가능
